## ⚠️ Note

Due to limited time:
- I built **only the most essential components** that reflect the main structure and functionality.
- I did **not fully match the typography and text styles** from the original Figma design, in order to prioritize layout, responsiveness, and core features.

This approach helped me focus on delivering key functionality within the available time.
